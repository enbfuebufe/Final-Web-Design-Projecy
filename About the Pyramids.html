			<td colspan=6 bgcolor=#ffefcf><p>The Pyramids of Giza, located near Cairo, Egypt, are ancient marvels built during the Fourth Dynasty of the Old Kingdom, around 2580 to 2560 BCE, as tombs for the pharaohs. The complex includes three main pyramids: the Great Pyramid of Khufu, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramid of Menkaure. The Great Pyramid, the largest, stood as the tallest man-made structure for over 3,800 years. These monumental structures, made of millions of limestone blocks, showcase the advanced engineering skills of the ancient Egyptians. The Pyramids of Giza are a lasting symbol of Egypt's rich history and ingenuity, remaining the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still largely intact.</p></td>
